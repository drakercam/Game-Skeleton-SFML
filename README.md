# What is this project?
This project is created from the SFML C++ Game Engine series on youtube by Sonar Systems.
Its a series in which he walks the viewer through creating a game engine with an asset manager, an input manager, a state machine and a game loop.

# Why did I want to make this?
It will allow for me to create many different clones of other games if I so please or maybe my own game whilst having most of the technical stuff up and going. All I need to do is create assets, adjust positions and window sizes, and actually manipulate logic for the game whilst in the game state.

# Where I left off
In the video series, I left off on 'Tic-Tac-Toe SFML C++ [STATE CREATION] GameState/Screen'. I will come back to this video to finish up created the game state and the pause state later on. I hope to use this "skeleton code" to fast track any games I make in SFML plus this video series provided me with great insight on state machines and how to handle various states.

# SHOUTOUT TO SONAR SYSTEMS ON YOUTUBE WOOOOOOOOOO

# Notes:
All textures and art work was created by me (not that I care if you steal it it is shit. But yes, no credits needed!)
